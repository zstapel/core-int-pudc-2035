    <p> At this moment in time I have been learning how to do acrylic nails and nail art on top. I also have been into doing more dramatic eye makeup looks. I am personally not a huge fan of movies, I can only watch them when I am in a specific mood, because I do not have the attention span for that long of a plot line. Right now I have been rewatching Gossip Girl and watching season 4 of Big Mouth. I am overwelmed right now due to finals so I haven't been able to do many things I normal enjoy doing. I am very excited for a break!
